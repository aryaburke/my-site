Code for my site.

Inspired by Zach Mandeville's <a href="https://coolguy.website/basic-html-competency-is-the-new-punk-folk-explosion/">Basic HTML Competency is the New Folk Punk Explosion</a>.

If you're my friend, feel free to fork the repo and rip a PR to add yourself to the <a href="https://github.com/aryaburke/my-site/blob/main/src/app/friends/page.tsx">Friends page</a>.

Made using a bunch of amazing open source software - see the `package.json` file for all the info.
