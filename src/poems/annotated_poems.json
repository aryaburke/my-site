Undone,\n\nI see myself in shapes: vanguard, harlequin, Sometimes-All.\nThings are forgotten — the dishes lie unused.\nThe same voice says the same things.\n\nAs if enlightened!\nSpit on my enlightenment.\nShit on it.\n\nI find awareness in facts,\nin sight. It comes and goes. My eyes blur\nand my prescription changes. Left alone in the dark\n\nI               I       I    I  I\nalways I. I tell a story\non I, my filler word,\n\nand so I decay. I’ve forgotten how to ask for help.\nEven if I could, I do not know what I need.\nI suspect Milo knows.\n\nWhat dark energies do I project?\nWishing it was gone, the world returns to fragments.\nCatherine is ever unsympathetic.\n\nI! Equal parts god and ghost,\nin hellish words repeated. \nWhen hellish worlds receded where was I?\n\nGone again to air.

Ordinary Sestina","year":"2018","body":"It’s a long time since we were by the brook.\nYou and your values\nhave changed since then. No longer— \nI’m not particularly inclined to write this sestina\nbut I’m forcing myself to practice\nin this blood red journal.\n\n*Rap is always about rap, poems about poetry.* Jotted in the journal,\ninescapable truth which form can barely brook.\nDays and days, a poem about my mother, I practice\nand practice. Still the poem values\nonly itself. Take, for instance, this sestina.\nI didn’t want it to be about poetry. Yet! 39 lines, no shorter, no longer.\n\nOf course, a sestina always ends up longer\nthan I’d think. Space on a page does not correlate to the marks in a journal.\nCarissa told me she became a poet through the trials of sestina.\nSix words, 39-line. Your tears become a brook.\nYou call me abusive cuz my safety, my values,\nI tell you to get the fuck out of my life, you piece of shit rapist.\nYour mask is off, but you have so much practice\n\ncatching people off guard that I can never tell. You should practice\ndrying your tears just a little longer— \ntoo quick of a recovery. I see it. Theater values\nthe genuine. As do I. Says so in this journal:\n*A decision has been made. Her tears drew a much wider brook\nthan yours may ever know.* It’s followed by a small sestina,\n\n36-line, forgot the envoi. A complicated form, that sestina,\nbut always worth the practice.\nIt thinks carefully about what matters, and will brook\nno deviations of form: 39-line, no-shorter-no-longer. \nJust a couple jots in the journal.\nForm has its values:\n\nTo make you question yours, always seen in a sestina\nyou cross out in your journal. Perdomo said poetry is practice,\na few minutes a day, a careful walk by the brook.\n","annotatedTitle":"The Ordinary Sestina","annotatedYear":"<a

Something holds her,\nperhaps herself, resentful\nas she is.\nWhat does it mean to be conscious?\nThe question, like all questions, is trite,\nlike us. Merriam-Webster, who is hard to trust,\nsays this:\n\n*1: having mental faculties\nnot dulled by sleep, faintness, or stupor;\nawake.* \nShe qualifies, about half the time.\nIt is excruciating.\n\n*2: perceiving, apprehending, or noticing\nwith a degree of controlled thought or observation.*\nI remember how she saw me break down\nwhen no one else did, the ticking fingers.\nIn hushed tones: *get it together.\nWhen you burn you burn us all.*\n\n*3: personally felt.*\nAlways there is anger and fear\nradiating from her coiled vessel.\nDissociation is a feeling,\nthough nothing is felt but absence.\nAbsence, too, is a feeling.\n\n*5: done or acting with critical awareness.*\nEven as she spirals she sees herself,\nsees in her surface reflected\nthe countless brands burned by a world\nlusting only for possession.\nEven the cruelest things, buried deep\nbelow her memory, find their absence noted.\n\n\n*8: archaic: sharing another’s knowledge or awareness\nof an inward state or outward fact.*\nWhen she was asked to write herself\nshe wrote her muscles and skin,\nall the people forever patchworked\nin her pride and her pain.\nShe knows the others in herself\nas she knows the masks she makes.\nShe knows this once she sits alone:\nTrust is a thing that sleeps too short\nand wakes up screaming.\n\n","annotatedTitle":"<a
