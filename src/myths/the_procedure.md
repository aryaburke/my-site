There was always low mist in the forest. Mist cloaking the trees, swaying the songs, encroaching the acres. Mist. Jessa remembered the mist. The property was lively back then, wood panels forming a fence. The fields were ploughed or newly sprouted, and children played swords in the yard. They would come and go, new ones and young ones, but there would always be swords: sticks snapped from trees, fireplace pokers, once a father’s knife, hastily snatched before any harm was done. The children would dance in circles, lunging and parrying, footwork the marker of finest wielder. It was a happy game, but never free from threats. A broken stick could splinter. The children would jeer from the sidelines, and when parents were absent their jeers cut more than their swords.

“Stop fightin’ like a fucking cunt, Jimmy.”

“Sausage-ass can’t even swing a stick.”

“Slice the faggot!”

After swords the children patted each other on the back, laughing. Often the boys would pat the loser hardest, pretending it was soft, even though it was hard enough to make them wince. No one ever made a sound, though.

The property was a bed and breakfast of sorts. Conceptually, a bit more abstract. Jessa’s aunts called it a come-and-go. People would come, some would stay, most would go. The economic side was never clear to Jessa. In fact, questioning her aunts only obfuscated it further. When Jessa asked how they made their money, what rates they charged, how Stinker Silas could possibly pay for months of staying yet never took a shower, the aunts would vaguely reference the value of the swimming pool, the rarity of local frog species. Never were rents and rates public. Never once, in fact, did Jessa witness a transaction, even an exchange of goods, between her aunts and the people of the property. Not once. Occasionally, someone would bake bread. That someone always worked as a chef at home, or had a passion for bread, or a keen interest in the biology of the yeast, its interactions with property air. It was never bread as payment. Always, it seemed, it was bread as celebration.

Jessa lived to her own devices. She couldn’t remember anything before the age of fourteen — her aunts said it was the accident, the car, her parents, traumatic brain injury. She could only remember the property, for the few years she’d been there, and she made up stories about it, retelling and reshaping them to herself so as never to forget. She had made up her mind: she wouldn’t forget a thing again. So she roamed the fields, mostly close, talking to herself.

“And this is where the rabbit coven lives,” she would say, stopping to inspect a hole. “Helloooo, rabbit coven.” She’d peer in, whistle a somber tune. “Goodbye, rabbit coven.”

The property was surrounded by the forest. At night, when the mist was light, Jessa would watch the forest from her west-facing window. She would curl in the alcove and stare. The trees would whistle a low, haunting thrum, waving faintly. The mist would seep out of the trees, almost shimmering over the ground, before dissolving. The forest looked as if it was a constant well of mist, exhaling it, slow tendrils leaving the patterned hollows between trees. Jessa watched for hours, drifting to sleep in the alcove.

Jessa needed the procedure. She didn’t want it, but she couldn’t keep on this way any longer. Her aunties said the same — it was time for her to get the procedure, before something broke forever inside her. She wished she had been born with an opening. Instead they needed her long thing, to open her up. That was what the procedure was about, her aunties told her. She knew she wanted an opening. She just didn’t want to leave this place. But without an opening, the place could leave her too.

On the day of the procedure, the property was quiet. It was what they called winter: snowless and chilly, lightless and gray. The leaves had all died. No children were playing on the lawn. Her aunties took her as far as the bus stop. And then she was alone. They never left the property further than where people would be picked up, or the Indian grocery store. They said they had to stay, that their hearts ached near death when they left. Jessa’s heart was aching. She didn’t know what she would find in the city, at the clinic. She knew she would be there for a month or more, that she would be taken care of. But that was the extent of it. It was transient, the bus, trundling its way from one particular place to another with no real end in sight. She wiped the dewy windows into sweeping waves. Jessa imagined it on a map, first one bus, drawing looping, meaningless lines over the country. Soon there were hundreds of buses, some trailing dotted red lines, some trailing pale blue, some trailing nothing at all, crafting empty designs over the map. It was as if they all circled something, but could never quite reach it.

*****

As Jessa exited the bus, she felt as if she was emerging from a protected place, emerging now into a world much harsher than the old one. She felt simultaneously in her skin and out of it, the sharp raindrops on her vibrating skin far away. She lifted her arm, curved it, examined her angular limbs, put a hand on a broad shoulder. Much broader than she always thought.

It was a quick walk from the bus stop to the clinic, as if the city already knew her destination. On the way, she counted six people. The slowest one was a woman, who stopped to gaze at weeds sprouting from the sidewalk. Even a few grassy fronds seemed to do. The fastest one was a man with an apparatus attached to his head. He walked swiftly, an angle towards his destination, eyes and nose covered. Jessa didn’t know what the other four were. She saw sharp chinbones, soft cheeks, lined and unlined hands.

Jessa waited for a long time in the entry room. The dirty metal walls were patterned with divots and scratches of brown. Jessa was obsessed with patterns. She loved mapping them in her head. Even the harshest textures pleased her, like the walls in front of her. When she let her eyes wander, unfocused, she saw a streaked metal landscape, swirling storms of rust. It reminded her of the leaves in fall, the way a hundred mottled reds grew together, seeping like watercolor, before leaving the branches empty. Then winter branches a nest, a needle blanket, a web, cracked veins. Immersed in textures, she barely noticed her name being called. When she left the room a cloaked man escorted her to a padded chair. Its room’s walls, by contrast, were very dull, and Jessa grew bored. Soon the doctor arrived.

“I’m the doctor,” they said, “but you can call me Boris. And you’re…”

“Jessa. From the forest.”

“Ah, Jessa from the forest,” said Boris, “Do you have any questions before we begin?”

“How long will it take?” Jessa asked.

“Approximately four hours,” Boris said, “but it depends on if we need grafts, how deep we can go, that sort of thing. As for the hospital, you’ll be here a month.”

“That’s quite long,” Jessa said, “the hospital time, I mean. The surgery seems a reasonable length.”

“Yes,” said Boris, “we need to make sure you heal properly.”

“Hmm. Can I keep what’s left? In a jar?”

“What for?” Boris said.

“I’ve always fantasized about eating it.”

They chuckled. “No. Strictly against procedure — not how it’s done. Now. Let’s proceed?” They smirked.

“If I can’t keep it, could you let me sink my teeth into it? Just for a second? That would be enough.”

“Put on this mask, please. You won’t feel a thing. That is, it’ll be viciously painful once you wake. But it could be much, much worse.” Jessa nodded, her face pale. She took the mask, a gas mask from an ancient war, and put it over her face. As she slipped away, she imagined her mouth-tube an elephant’s trunk, drinking from a life-giving pool. A light rain began to fall on the pool, and its serene waters were soon blanketed with ripples. It distracted her from Boris’ wheezing breaths, until she felt nothing.

Jessa was at a show. She was surrounded by bodies. Onstage naked, anthropomorphic figures were suspended by chains lit up by red light. At the stage’s center was a man, masked and tattooed, fingers darting in and out of a machinic monstrosity. It was an amalgam of knobs and wires, emitting a deafening, horrific static that screeched and whirred each time the man’s fingers darted over a knob. When the static pulsed louder, Jessa thought that her ears were bleeding. She put a finger to her head. Her ears were bleeding. The chained figures writhed. One started to scream. Another went totally limp, lifeless, and was lowered.

Someone next to Jessa handed her a cup. She turned her head sideways and let her blood drip into it. She closed her eyes, and put her handkerchief in her other ear. Someone patted her back.

*****

Jessa came to in a room that was blue curtains. She was lying on a bed; she couldn’t move. She groaned.

“Jessa? You awake?” a high voice came from behind the curtain to her right. Jessa groaned again. “Yep, you’re awake! Finally! It’s been days. I’ve been so lonely in this clinic. Nurse only comes once a day. People sometimes, but they’re never here for me. They’re here to watch, maybe, to peer inside of me, ooh and ahh, or to stand at the back and take notes, but never for me. It’s really lonely. Like I told you. I wasn’t sure you’d ever wake up! I’ve just been eating the mush. I keep asking for tikka masala, but there’s never tikka masala. There’s never even mac ‘n cheese. There’s just mashed potatoes. At best. I’m not even sure. I have to stand to pee. But I can’t stand up! I have to pee all day, hold in my bladder. The nurse who helps me pee never comes. She makes me stand on the toilet! I never pee otherwise, I can’t even—”

“Who are you?” Jessa said.

 	“Ailie,” she said. She paused. “You interrupted me.”

“Oh,” said Jessa. In the awkward silence following, she felt her body. She felt the crumbling ache, radiating from her center, pulling her body hollow. She felt its need for agony. “I’m in pain,” she said.

“Me too.”

*****

Jessa spent every day with Ailie. Or really, Ailie’s voice. The curtain between them was never pulled back, and so Jessa stared at the blue wrinkles, listening to the running words behind them. Ailie spoke. And spoke. Jessa didn’t mind — she was in pain.  Ailie’s monologue quieted the violent shedding in her core. She felt as if she was shedding, metamorphosing in her cot, her old skin ready to be cracking and white. She often imagined it as Ailie talked, her skin crumbling into the dirt, using her supple new fingers to peel the last of the dryness from the back of her neck. She would keep some skin, tape it in her notebook. She swore she would.

Ailie only ever stopped when the students came. The Meddling Meddies, Ailie called them, behind their back. The meddling meddies were medical students, teal-clad boys with scruffy goatees, herded by a somber Boris. They would stand outside Ailie and Jessa’s space, murmuring in the hallway. Sometimes they were loud enough to hear: “What are they? After the procedure… does it change their personality? Would they commit a crime, do you think? And the procedure… it can’t truly change them, can it? It’s just cosmetic. They must have bled like pigs. Like pigs…”

When they left Ailie would talk about chopping their heads. “We can’t let them make a spectacle of us! We’re human beings, Jessa, not pigs, not rabbits, not anything, and we can’t let those meddling meddies ruin our lives! I say the guillotine, the electric chair, the black pills to any goateed man who scrutinizes us. We can’t stand for this!”

“We can’t stand at all,” Jessa said.

“We can with the nurse’s help,” Ailie said. Jessa wondered how long they had been in the hospital. She lost track on the fourth day. She had tried to measure, but there were no clocks, and no natural light. Nothing was consistent. Sometimes it seemed they had twelve meals in a few hours, and other times Jessa felt she was Jesus of Nazareth, crawling across the desert, searching for a bite to eat. But there was no crawling. Just waiting.

“I had a dream last night,” Ailie said, “I think I’m getting out soon. I can just feel it. In the dream I was blonde, and my husband and I got trapped on a floating island by this evil couple. There was wire mesh surrounding the whole island. We thought it was safe, but it wasn’t. It wasn’t. They shot him in a cornfield, and then used a lever to lower the corn while I fled with his body. They hid, in a house. They didn’t want me to find out I could escape. My husband died. The whole island, it was beautiful, full of green groves and windy fields. I was on a small flying machine, open-air, and I was standing, grabbing the poles at my sides, trying desperately to hold on and to flirt with the woman beside me. It was dreadfully hard. It was exhilarating. The plane landed. But the airport was its own affair, treacherous, lined with escalators and cameras. No escalator went where it appeared to. Everything was winding, the whole structure was circular. I was just trying to get my baggage. But I was on a slide, into another plane. I didn’t want to be there. But I was.” 

Ailie paused.

“I wonder if I’ll go back,” she said, “back to the island.” Jessa felt, in her silence, a gap. Ailie had stopped. She was reflecting. Jessa had wondered what Ailie felt like, constantly speaking, never having the chance to think on what she said. Jessa was the opposite. She couldn’t remember being able to speak more than a sentence or two at once. It tired her, speaking, especially to others. When her words ran dry she imagined herself at an engagement, standing before a massive audience, red curtains at her back. The people had come from all the land to see her. To see her speak. At the podium, she would pause, take in their great silence. Then she would curtsy, a half-smile flitting over her face, and disappear behind the curtains. She imagined thunderous applause.

Before she could break the gap, Boris entered. Their nail polish, turquoise, was chipping. They stared at Jessa. Jessa stared at them. They placed a knotted, bloodstained plastic bag on her bedside table.

“It’s what’s left,” they whispered, and fled.

“Was that Boris?” Ailie said.

“Yes. He left me a bloody bag.” Jessa poked at it. “I think it might be what’s left over. From the procedure.”

“I asked him to keep my parts too, you know,” Ailie said, “and just because you’re his favorite doesn’t mean he doesn’t still bring the meddies, fucking two face. But Jessa, I’m grinning. I’m so happy for you.”

******

Jessa returned at night. She stepped silently onto the property, skirting around the entry lights. No one would be awake long past sunset, but carelessness had its costs. She let the cobble beneath her feet become dirt, and soon the mist was wrapping itself around her ankles. She entered the forest with the bag in her pocket. The sounds of croaking frogs, just behind the trees, grew louder.

Jessa couldn’t see further than the trunks in front of her. Behind her looked exactly the same. The mist glowed a pale, effervescent blue, its dim light replacing the stars. On her skin it was clustered dewdrops. Jessa stopped. She remembered dewdrops — there were dewdrops on the windshield. There were dewdrops on the windshield. Dewdrops ran with teardrops. A rabbit darted in front of her, paused in her path. Jessa hummed. The rabbit cocked its head, listening, before hopping away.

Soon the constant ground gave way to pools of water. First they were small, but soon grew bigger, the path winding around them. Jessa had never seen so many blues —  there were azures, teals, shimmering pales of the water. When the path ended, ahead lay only water, water crowded with mist. Jessa gasped at its iridescence. She knelt, and pulled her fingers through its tensions. They rippled. They gave way. Jessa opened up the soggy bag, let her blood run with the water, watched it all wash together. The surface was opaque, but Jessa felt, in her hands, a kind of softness.
