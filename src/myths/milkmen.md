Stories like these, they’re always about the house. Ingrown walls. Splintered, rotting panels. A red-roofed turret, intact by some ancient miracle. Trees on three sides. A road on the last one. Take the cracked stairway to the crooked door. It was a house.

It was a house. Psion and Jeremy lived there, in the house. Psion and Jeremy. Psion and Jeremy drank milk. Powdered stuff. The house had many rooms, and in the dining room was a table. On that table was a huge crate of powder. The powdered milk had a teaspoon in it, for divvying. Psion was hunched over the table, divvying. A pile of bags. Bags empty, divvied, full. Powder spilled all over the table, coated it in grey-white. Psion was shirtless as usual, revealing the tall, scabby tattoo on his pallid chest. PUR, thickly scrawled, cramped between his right arm and distended nipple. The bottom of the R was barely there, as if someone would return to it later. Chickenscratch. It was uneven, clearly picked at. 

“How many?” Jeremy asked. He was in the doorway, his curly hair silhouetted by the dim kitchen light.

“Glass for milk,” Psion said.

“How many?”

“Jeremy.” 

Jeremy moved slowly, filled a glass from the tap. The water was murk, with sinking brown flakes. He put it on the table.

“Straight from the teat,” he said. Psion dumped five teaspoons in and stirred with his finger. He sucked on his finger.

“Mmm. Two hundred. Tomorrow,” Psion said.

“You’ll lose track.”

“You know you can’t use the spoon, Jeremy.”

“Glass of milk?” Jeremy said.

“When I’m done.” Psion chugged. Foamy milk dribbled down the sides of his face, his chest. Milk touched his tattoo, and he screeched. The glass shattered on the ground. Milk pooled. 

“Fuck!” 

“Milk on an open wound,” Jeremy said. Psion dug his finger into his tattoo, grimaced, tried again. Milk seeped from the edges of it. PUR looked deflated, lumpy.

“Fucking take the spoon, Jeremy. You do it for once,” Psion said. 

Jeremy heard the stairs creak loudly as Psion stomped up. It would all collapse one day. Jeremy took a glass, filled two teaspoons, stirred with a twig. He began counting the full baggies of powder, each one teaspoon.

*****

The house, circled by woods. Out front was a long paved road. No lines painted on it, just asphalt, running and twisting through the trees. The borders of the house stiffened. You couldn’t see any further down the road from the house, if there was anything at all. The forest was a damp green murk. That’s as much as Jeremy could imagine, when he tried. He liked to imagine, even for a second, the house from a distance, the house as if it were simply what it was, the house as if it were not the consumption that ruled his world. The house as a house.

They were standing in the yard, waiting by the road. Jeremy was in tattered blue jeans. Psion was shirtless again, a fresh black E on his chest in stark contrast to his snow-white skin. PURE didn’t even reach halfway across his chest. He was hairless, like a mole rat. Jeremy couldn’t remember him with hair. Psion was smoking a cigarette, shading his eyes from the early morning sun. He took a drag. He took another. He handed Jeremy his cigarette and puked on the ground, expelling an amoeba of pink rot. He took his cigarette back. He took a drag.

“The dog died?” Psion said.

“Weeks ago,” said Jeremy.

“Weeks?” 

From the distance, loud rattling. It grew until the eighteen-wheeler was upon them, screeching to a stop in the road. Its engine stayed growling. The huge decal on the side was a cow splashing in an ocean of milk. The whole cargo bay was made to look like the ocean of milk, and the cow’s alarm showed clearly in its wide eyes and spread hooves. HEIFER, it read. HEIFER MILK. Psion’s eyes locked with Jeremy’s, and he leaned his head at the truck. Jeremy grabbed the bag, which contained all of the previous day’s divvied milk powder, and walked towards the back of the truck. 

Inside was a hulking arachnid, webbed to the walls with thick ropes that trapped its bulk. Its front two legs tapped up and down the walls, seeking. Its eyes were clustered, hollow, peering. Jeremy threw the bag, and the spider grabbed it, slid it back into the darkness of the storage chamber. It put its point on a piece of paper and slid it to Jeremy, chittering. Jeremy understood none of its sounds. Its head jerked. It sounded desperate.

“Why do you always make me do that?” Jeremy said when he returned to Psion.

“Bug nightmares. My PTSD. I don’t fuck with the milkmen.”

“Well, it gave us this.” Jeremy handed Psion the paper, which he unfolded.



PARTY. SIX DAYS. EXPECT GUESTS.



“We don’t take guests,” Psion said.

“You can read,” said Jeremy.

“Fuck you. I don’t want guests.”

“Like they’ll care.”

Psion stared at him. “Milk.” 

Jeremy, head bowed, rushed inside to fetch a glass.

*****

Jeremy came to on the milkroom floor. He was under the table. His body was surrounded by white, spilled powder and milk-stains from many days and nights surrounding him. His head was near the shattered glass. He took a long shard of glass and massaged it, lightly feeling its vicious edges. He pocketed it and lifted himself, stuck his finger in the milk crate, licked it. It was bitter at first, but once it melted into his spit, it tasted soft at the edges. Metallic, but soft.

“Psion?” Jeremy said.

Nothing. He walked into the kitchen, ran the tap. The house was pulsing. He looked at the walls, the peeling rust on the iron panels. It flaked as it always did. The house was pulsing. It was as if something was drilling into it from below, applying pressure towards the surface, cracking its foundations. Jeremy climbed the stairs.

The pulsing grew louder. It went to vibrating, to harsh buzzing, to violent blaring. Jeremy shouldered open the door between him and the noise. Psion, naked, was hunched over the floor. He looked up at Jeremy.

“What the fuck are you doing?” Jeremy asked.

“Making beats.” 

Psion was surrounded by machinery, spare wires running to cogs and canisters, a mess of spokes and blinking screens. He turned and held up his hand. Wires had been stabbed into each of his fingers. His cock was out, throbbing, its head an angry red.

“Watch,” Psion said.

Psion closed his fist, then fell again to the floor, contorted. The room filled with bass, feedback, industrial grinding. The walls shook. Dirt fell from the ceiling. Jeremy’s ears popped, and he felt like he was grinding his teeth into sand. He pulled Psion off the floor, pried open his fist, and yanked out the bloody wires. Psion screamed. He had bit his tongue. Red seeped from between his lips. His tattoo, unevenly scabbed, now halfway across his chest, read: PURE ID. Psion spat at Jeremy.

“We need music for the party, don’t we, don’t we? Don’t we?” Psion’s eyes looked pried open.

“We don’t need to do anything we don’t want to for the party. It’s ours,” said Jeremy.

“You call it ours?” Psion cackled. “Go get me milk, Jeremy.”

“Stay out of rooms we haven’t been in.”

“We’ve never, ever had a party,” Psion said. 

“Please, Psion. Please.”

“Milk. Now.”  Psion’s face was savage. Jeremy scuttled downstairs, Psion’s noise fading behind him. The drilling hadn’t stopped when Jeremy pulled the wires.

*****

They were divvying, together, each with a teaspoon. There were three spoons now. The third was a tablespoon, stained, in the middle of the powder’s dunes. Baggies were filling silently, a bagpile on the table growing hour by hour. Divvying and divvying. Jeremy wiped the sweat from his forehead. Psion dropped the teaspoon into the milk, his shaking fingers finding their way to the tablespoon. He scooped an overflow of powder into his mouth. A second scoop, a third. He grimaced, swallowed. He was pallid.

“Jeremy. Water.”

“Why are we doing this?” Jeremy said.

“Jeremy.”

“Bags. Thousands and thousands of bags.”

“Jeremy. Water.” PURE IDEO.

“But why?” Jeremy said.

“No questions,” Psion said.

“You don’t tell me anything.”

“Water.”

“Why don’t you tell me anything?” Jeremy grabbed the tablespoon from his hand and scooped quickly, powder disappearing down his throat. He spat. “Fuck you, Psion.” 

Psion hit him. His nose spurted blood, and he cried out. Psion leapt over the table, bestial in stride, pinning Jeremy to the ground with his hands and knees. His left hand wrapped around Jeremy’s throat. Then he picked Jeremy up and threw him at the wall, his famished arms pulling monstrously, and he was hitting Jeremy, again and again.

“Is this what you want, Jeremy?” he screamed. “Is this what you want? I don’t know a thing. You hear me? I don’t know a fucking thing. You want to know, Jeremy? You want to know, you shiteater?” 

Jeremy played dead. Psion got up, filled his bloody hand with powder and tried to swallow. He let out an animal scream, choking as the powder touched his new tattoo. He fell to his knees, ripping at his chest, before staggering up the stairs and collapsing onto the second floor. Jeremy heard his body thump and began to weep. For the first time, the house took on a satisfied silence. Nearly all the bags were full. Blood pooled onto its hungry boards.

*****

The needle dug into Psion’s skin, hundreds of times a second. The coils of the tattoo machine were ragged, sparking, and the gun itself a greening copper. Psion was standing, looking down at his oozing chest, finishing the G in his PURE IDEOLOG tattoo. They were in the portrait room. The walls were covered in sketched, ancient, pox-ridden faces in uneven frames. All the eyes in the room followed you. It was where Psion got voltage. Jeremy was in the corner, kneeling, hands clasped. His only movements were his breaths.

“Praying?” Psion laughed.

“What of it?” Jeremy’s eye was black.

 “When’s the last time you prayed?”

“Yesterday.”

“And before that?”

“You have a welt on your back,” Jeremy said

“It’s not a welt. It’s an egg.” Psion turned back to his work.

“An egg?”

“It’s an egg.” Psion paused. “I dreamt that milk tarantula came into my room last night. It was all up on the walls, sneaky and silent. I knew. I couldn’t move. It wasn’t making any noise, but I heard the chittering of thousands of little tiny spiders. It put its sharp ass in my back and laid an egg in me. That’s the spiders. They’re gonna hatch. That motherfucker left its freaky shit kids in me.”

Jeremy’s eyes widened. “That’s just a dream,” he said. “That’s just a dream.”

“You dream, Jeremy?”

“Nope.”

“Thought so. I dream. I dream all the time.” Psion said.

“I know.”

“I dream the same thing, usually. I dream that I’m at the crucifixion of Christ. Jesus Christ. I’m the tank, the big guy, the Roman guard throwing him down into the sand and sticking my fat cock into his skinny little asshole while he cries for help. When I take my cock out it’s covered in blood. Blood and shit. I make him lick it ‘til I blow a load in his eyes. He’s begging, and the other guards, they just watch. Then we nail him down and haul up the cross.” Psion looked at Jeremy. “I kiss him, before he goes up. You should know that. I kiss him.” Psion had run out of ink. The needle looked like it was burning him, harsh red marks replacing the black. Psion looked down.

“I’m out,” he said. “No ink in the whole house.”  

“You’re done?” Jeremy didn’t look up. He was shaking.

“Does it look done, you fuckup? I need a Y.” The tattoo gun clattered to the floor. He rummaged through drawers until he found a red-handled crystal chisel. He held it up to the light.

“Ghost iron,” he said.

“That’s glass, asswipe.” Jeremy said, bitterness seeping from his words. His eyes tracked Psion’s response closely. He had his hand in his pocket, fingering his shard.

Psion didn’t even look at him. “Milk.” 

Jeremy walked downstairs. Psion wrapped both hands around the handle and dug. His skin sloughed off in hunks. He made quick progress on his ribcage until he had a massive, bleeding Y. Psion stared at the stringy, mutilated flesh, his face blank. His skin was in tatters. Jeremy opened the door and laughed.

“PURE IDEOLOGY, huh?” Jeremy said.

Psion held out his hand. Jeremy handed him a glass of cream-white slop, and downed one himself. “There go your arteries.”

“It couldn’t wait,” Psion muttered. He looked up at a glaring portrait of Benjamin Franklin. “What are you looking at?” 

Ben’s face remained unchanged.

*****

“Is today the day?” Psion asked. 

They were standing outside, gazing back at the house. Its turret looked near toppling, although they had never set foot on the top floor. The storm gutter had fallen crosswise, its shabby metal blocking the stairs to the patio. The house was septic. Things were crumbling in on themselves. Muffled thumping came from within.

“Today,” Jeremy said. 

Psion’s nostrils were tinged with powder. His scarring had inflated, ballooning, oozing pus. His whole chest was a swollen, burning red, the text lumpy and distorted. 

“Should we get the mail?” Psion said.

“Mail?” Jeremy said.

“You know you can’t get the mail, Jeremy.” Psion stared into space. Jeremy slowly turned his head to Psion, his eyes thoughtful. The corners of his mouth hid a smile.

“Yes, Psion,” Jeremy said, “Why don’t you get the mail? There could be something very important there.” Psion wandered towards the corner of the yard, out towards the road. His steps were slow. He stood at the edge of the corner and looked down the road. Jeremy watched him. He disappeared around the corner, and Jeremy’s eyes widened. He didn’t think Psion would cross out of the property. Then he breathed a sigh of relief. He laid down on the grass, feeling its soft cushion on his bony arms. 

His relief didn’t last long. It never did. Psion emerged onto the road, leaning heavily forward as he turned towards the house. He was accompanied by a petite, purple-haired girl who walked confidently, clearly eyeing her surroundings. When they reached Jeremy, she stuck out her hand. Psion’s body was trembling.

“I’m Rel,” she said.

“Jeremy,” he said. “How’d you get here? Isn’t the road dangerous?”

“I figured you’d know not to ask,” she said, “Party’s inside?” She smiled. Her white teeth shone.

“I’ll show you,” Psion said, touching the back of her arm. She brushed away his hand. “Jeremy, you stay here. Watch for guests,” he continued. 

“I’m not the first one here, am I?” Rel said.

“No. I am,” said Psion.

“He means yes, you are,” Jeremy said.

“Besides me. And you,” Psion muttered.

“That won’t do,” Rel said. “Come with us, Jeremy. It’s no party with just two.” Jeremy shrugged, looked at a hunched Psion, who didn’t return his glance. Nobody moved.

“Well?” She said. Psion wasn’t looking at either of them. Jeremy ducked under the broken gutter, and Rel followed. A panel had fallen off the far wall, revealing the black-mold supports underneath.

“Nice place you got here,” she said, chuckling.

“Why thank you,” Psion said from behind her. “Would you like some milk?”

“What kind?” she said.

“Organic. From the milker’s market.”

“Is it pasteurized?” She asked. Psion stared at her. “You know? Fried? Heat-wiped? Gets the disease out?” A long silence. “Will the milk infect me?”

“Oh.” He stammered. “No, milk can’t infect you.”

“Why do we pasteurize, then?” No answer.

“Milk can infect you,” Jeremy said.

“That’s clear,” Rel said.

She stared at the table, powder-covered. The crate was gone, replaced by two cracked pitchers of milk. A maggot squirmed on the table next to it. The thrumming bass was a growing, corrosive static. 

“I could boil the milk?” Psion said.

“Fuck off. Where’s the bathroom?” Rel said.

Psion pointed. The door was through a dim hall. It opened into whitewashed fluorescent tile and brown stalls, scrawled and graffitied. She went in. Psion stood next to the doorway. He eyed Jeremy, wordless and bloodshot. They stared at each other until she came out.

“Great party,” she said. Outside, a behemoth truck screeched to a stop, and crackling static filled the house. The three of them rushed to the grass, Psion cackling. The noise grew to piercing before diffusing into rumbling, thunderous groans. 

“Look, Jeremy,” Psion said, “my hands.” His fingertips, recently scabbed from the wires, were cracked and bleeding. Rel slapped his hands away.

The driver, a hollow-eyed man, stepped from the cabin and walked to the back of the truck. He opened the massive cargo bay. He began chittering, and then stepped to the side to make way for two leviathan spiders. The arachnids scuttled out onto the grass, turned towards the three of them, shivered. Holloweyes walked towards the three of them.

“Psion. Jeremy,” he said. It was a question delivered as a command. The two nodded. Holloweyes overpowered them with his piercing stare. Even without the spiders he would be imposing. His eyes demanded deference.

“This is a party. Enjoy it. Stay in the house until the spiders call,” Holloweyes said. The spiders were leering, quivering on their spindly legs, tiny under their bloated bodies. Psion was whimpering.

“Shut up, Psion,” Rel said. Holloweyes smirked and walked towards the truck. The spiders scuttled towards them, paused over the three. Four black eyes framed their vicious, dripping fangs. The spiders spoke to each other in creaks, fangs fluttering, before dashing across the lawn. 

As Holloweyes’ truck began to lumber away, marching away from the house’s horizon, strangers began to flood from the road where Rel and Psion had come from. The house’s throbbing scream grew louder, accompanied by a cacophony of rapid conversations from the shifting mass of people.

“What the fuck?” Jeremy said. Rel grabbed his hand. The mass was hunched and gangly, rigid and misshapen, morbidly obese and stick-thin, covered in tattoos, in scars, in sores, elders and children, everything. The ones whose gazes had any life were talking to each other excitedly. The rest shambled towards the house. Each face Jeremy could make out looked very, very unwell.

“You’ll fit right in,” Rel said to Psion.

“Mailmen are trouble,” he responded. His lifeless eyes had sparked once again.

*****

Flesh and form filled the house. The scratching, chaotic bass could’ve made Jeremy’s ears bleed. When he closed his eyes he could feel it seeping down the sides of his head. He stood at the table, now pushed into the corner, filling cup after soggy cup with milk, mixing a pitcher, filling. Rotting men shook his hand in thanks. He watched two young boys playing tag, dashing between legs, laughing and bopping each other’s noses. One had curly black hair. They barely looked at the people. Above them, a rotting man screeched with the static. Jeremy gazed out the window to the yard, watching the arachnid horrors work. They were digging. One would stand above their hole, then use its gangly legs to leap into the sky, coming down on all eight, stretching and scrabbling wildly to push dirt outwards. The spider would then shake off a cloud of dirt, and the other would take its place. They repeated the jumping, the manic scrabbling, and sure enough, their hole was widening.

“Milk,” Psion said. Jeremy jumped back, startled. He was bent forwards over the table.

“You scared me.” Jeremy said, handing him a full cup. Psion chugged, and it ran down his chest, streaking through PURE IDEOLOGY.  It mixed with new blood from the scratched-at scab of his Y. His whole body shook. He hunched his shoulders, opened them wide, then pulled the cup from his lips, grimacing. His bloodshot eye twitched. His grin was lopsided.

“Stay away from the girl. Don’t you fucking go and trust her, Jeremy. Not now,” Psion said. He turned into the crowd, nearly losing his balance, before lurching into the mess. Jeremy tracked the crowd.

“Jeremy,” Rel said, “enjoying yourself?” She was standing at the table.

“Not much. It’s crowded.” He said. She shook her head.

“Even for them, this is disgusting.”

“Noxious,” he said, nodding.

“Septic,” she said, then grinned. They were close enough to hear each other. 

“Just urine-soaked,” he said, and they laughed. 

“Come on. Why are you serving all this milk? People can serve themselves.” Jeremy looked at the floor. “It’s Psion, isn’t it?” she said.

“Yeah,” he said.

“That bastard couldn’t tell the difference between you and a fish right now,” she said. “Probably hasn’t been able to for a long time. Come on. Let’s go upstairs.” Jeremy looked at her, shocked. “It’s been a while since you’ve had fun, huh Jeremy?” she said. “A house like this, a party like this? Those crawlers, digging a pit in the yard? It’s going to get a lot worse than this. Let’s get away for a bit.” 

A withered man stumbled into the table, and Rel jumped away. He grabbed a jug of milk and fumbled it onto the ground. It smashed. Immediately people were on their knees, lapping at the viscous puddle. Tiny rivulets of blood corrupted the pale milk, cuts from licking broken glass. Their heads moved to the house’s malevolent rhythm. 

“See?” Rel said, “They can serve themselves.” Jeremy shook his head.

“Yeah. Let’s.” Her hands were soft. She pulled him towards the stairs. 

*****

The spiders had screamed. Rel and Jeremy were ducked below the sill of an upper window, watching in horrified silence. The house was shaking. They could feel its vibration beneath their feet. 

The massive pit was fenced with webs. The arachnids were pulling people into it, two at a time, for a brutal fight. They would pick people out of the crowd, push them forward, chitter and squeal as the humans ravaged each other until one had nothing left. Many of the wasted people were angry and eager, and hopped onto each other like dogs. On the edges, the party raged, crowds cheering when a gladiator ripped into their kill. Psion stumbled among the mess, an overflowing jug in hand. An old woman ripped the arm off a rat-like man. Psion whistled at the dangling strands of flesh. 

One of the hairy spiders turned, trapped Psion between two legs. He writhed. It tossed him offhandedly into the pit, grabbed out the body and the woman, and dropped them both onto the growing pile of corpses at the edge of the arena. The woman stumbled off. Psion was wailing.

“He’ll rip some bastard apart,” Jeremy said.

“Like he does to you?” Rel said, looking sidelong.

“Oh no,” Jeremy said. Rel gasped. The other spider had picked the curly-haired child who had been playing tag. He was gasping for breath between sobs. Psion quieted, leaned down. His cockroach spine shivered with glee. He gestured for the child to come towards him.

Rel grabbed Jeremy and pulled him to the ground.

“Don’t watch,” she said.

“That motherfucker,” he said. He was tense.

“Don’t watch,” she said, grabbing his face, “do you understand me? They’ll kill us if we go down there. And I won’t get my head ripped off by some pincers for a stupid stunt.”

Jeremy collapsed into her.

“Come on,” she said, “let’s go to a different room.” She lowered him towards the floor and crawled towards the door. There was a high-pitched scream. Jeremy flinched, took a breath, and kept crawling.

*****

“We make our own web,” Rel said, “when we can’t live in theirs.” She pulled the final knot into place, then hoisted Jeremy by pulling a rope over the beam. She pulled another, and another, tying them together over his head. His arms and legs were splayed amongst the ropes, crisscrossed, him at the center of the knotted fiber web. One leg was higher than the other, and he dangled like a ballerina, perfectly in place. The taut ropes vibrated from the house’s colossal shaking. Jeremy could feel it to his core, every sound shivering from every side. He exhaled. 

“The ropes know how to hold you up,” she said.

“How will I get down?” he said.

“Just trust me.”

*****

In the morning nearly everything was gone. Jeremy and Rel walked through the wretched living room. Milk and shit stained the walls. The door was clean off its hinges.  They surveyed the wreckage outside. A pile of corpses clouded by flies. They could hear their buzz from the porch. They fed on decay. No living people. No spiders. For that Jeremy was grateful. 

“Is that you, Jeremy?” Psion’s voice was strained. It came from the pit. 

“I’ll be by the road,” Rel whispered. Jeremy nodded.

He stayed silent until he could peer over the edge. Psion was webbed and cocooned to the bottom of the pit, a stretched pile of spider silk surrounding his mouth and neck. His eyes were covered.

“It’s me, Psion.” Jeremy said.

“Get me milk.” Psion said, “Get me out of here.” 

Jeremy took the shard of glass from his jeans pocket and massaged its smooth surface. He pricked his finger on its sharp point, and a drop of blood emerged.

“What happened to the boy?” Jeremy said.

“What boy?”

“The one you fought.” Jeremy said. Psion cackled.

“The pile.” Psion said. Jeremy ran up the side of the pit. “Don’t bother!” Psion said. His voice cracked. “Jeremy. Help me.”

Jeremy stared at the curly-haired corpse, his arm bent unnaturally over his head. His neck sported mottled purple bruises. His shirt was ripped up and bloodied. His pants were gone. And where his prepubescent penis would be was instead a bloody hollow of flesh, innards pooled between his thighs. Jeremy walked into the pit and started sawing. He broke the silk around Psion’s cocoon strand by strand until the cocoon was no longer tethered to the ground.

“Hurry. I need milk.” Psion said. His voice was urgent. Jeremy rolled over his cocoon. Psion hit the dirt with a thud. He groaned. Jeremy made a cut in the top left corner of Psion’s back, where his welt had grown to a swollen, fiery mound. The tip of the glass pierced the welt, and Jeremy watched a tiny black thing start to push itself out the incision. Psion’s breathing grew quicker.

“Jeremy? Jeremy. Please. Jeremy.” Jeremy gazed at the crumbling house. He imagined a monstrous chittering mass, swelling with hundreds of tiny spiders, millions of spindly legs devouring a screaming Psion. He wanted them to web him up and surround him, bury him, fucking drown him in eyes.

The house toppled. The pillar holding up the porch cracked clean in half, and then the whole roof collapsed inwards, and the house deflated, loosing a metallic shriek as its rotting boards finally gave way. The ground shook when the turret’s dried-blood roof hit the dirt. When Jeremy emerged from the pit, the house was no longer. Just maggots and metal and buried milk.

Let nothing enter this defiled ground, thought Jeremy. Let it waste and be reclaimed.

*****

Jeremy and Rel sat where the road met the forest. It was as far from the wreckage as they could be. The lawn was silent.

“There should be a bus,” Jeremy said.

“What?” Rel said, “No way. No buses from the cat village.”

“What?” 

“A story my grandpa used to tell me. A man takes a bus to visit his lover. He gets off at the wrong stop. He’s in a cat village. He recognizes his old cat, his dead cat. He hides in the attic. The next day, when he sneaks to the bus stop, the bus never comes. No buses do. He never figures out how to leave.”

“That’s the end of the story?” Jeremy said.

“There’s no bus.” 

“It would take us away.”

“Come on,” Rel said, “there’s no bus. Stand up.”
